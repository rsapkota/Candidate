# Candidate
Assumption: 
This app would not require much logic, hence I've not added service layer. 
Visual studio needs to be installed with Sql Localdb and .net 8.0


Adding a service layer would help if there will be more complex logic in future. Service layer can serve a place to isolate all the business logic.
